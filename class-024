The disparity from males to females is much worse than I had originally thought. Diversity of race, sex, identity, ethnicity are all important in our field because we can bring all sorts of ideas that others would think of. You'll have more people thinking of a solution with their own unique way onto it which could be better or worse from each other. Bringing with them valuable experience. I sure do hope everyone of every background would join us in this field.
