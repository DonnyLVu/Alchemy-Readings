# Code Challenge 01 - JS fundamentals

### Objects

1. Basics

- You can shorthand properties that are the same  and can be used simplified.

2. Computed Properties

- You have to put [] around an computed expression.

### Classes 

1. Creation

- how to create classes, use constructors as well as to be able to use methods within the classes body.

2. Statics

- Static methods start by having static before the name, it cannot be called on by objects created by those objects. 

3. Extends

- Classes can inherit properties from other classes and become their child. Which then is able to acess stuff from its parents.

### Destructuring

1. Arrays

- Arrays are there to allow us to create shorter optimized code which things like brackets.

2. Strings

- Same things are applied to strings as well.

3. Objects

- Seems just a more harder to do, but is simular to above destructurings. 

4. Destructuring with Defaults

- You can set a default value while destructuring so it always has some number there even when the array doesnt have anything.

5. Destructuring Function Parameters

- Destrucuring as a whole is quite confusing without a lecture about this.

6. Destructuring with Alias

- Destructuring with renaming or renamed properties.

### Rest

1. Rest as a Parameter

- Groups up all the remaning arrs into a new array after others have been used.

2. Rest while Destructuring

- You can actually use Rest during destructuring which is neat. 

### Spread

1. Array Spread 

- Spread is just like rest, but the opisite in which it spreads out the arrays instead of condensing it

### Function Defaults

1. Function Defaults

- Giving default values on functions could possibly make your function not break if something would have been undefined.
