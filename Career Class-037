Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.

That's pretty much is express middleware which means we already had at least some experience with it already.

OOOooooOoo Custom middleware sounds pretty useful if you know how its used and created.

redux middleware is written in nested functions, specifically 3 nests.

middleware can modify dispatch to accept things that are not plain action objects.

^ pretty useful.
