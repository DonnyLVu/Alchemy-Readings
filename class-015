In Shays Howe's article had answers to some of the questions i had before with how people made mobile friendly sites. I didn't know that they could be an entirely new website that just has all the same things in it as the main one.

CSS floats is something I probably wont like as I feel like flex or grid would be easier to use in most cases.

Grid article only made it more my style than float.

CSS Float using the Escalator is a very nice visual helper, at least to me than the boxes in the all about floats article.
