I'm definitely excited (albeit nervous to go back to react) to work with the front end after so long.Â 

setState is the good stuff on making react function good.

Keys should have a unique string Id among its siblings.

Lists should loop through with a map function

components should be thought of as independent parts that can be reused anywhere.

Snapshot testing seems like a very useful test method.

React testing is something that basically makes you test stuff better.
