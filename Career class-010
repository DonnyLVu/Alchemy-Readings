Routing for me is one of the easier aspects of stuff as long as i keep my naming sense correct.Supertest is getting easier and easier to use with more repetition, as that's what practice is.I don't know all these readings about middleware is going to be super hard in practice or one of the easier aspects of what we have been doing so far.
