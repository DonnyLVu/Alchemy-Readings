The HTTP protocol was a nice little skim of reading, it was fun seeing all the errors that I would possibly come across one of these days.The comic was a nice read, things should be in comic form of explanation more often.The video is a nice watch that gives more clear ideas of what the heck is Rest.And as always, useful bookmarks booked marked.
