My feelings on destructuring is that its just a weirder way to refactor stuff.

On spread its funny to know that "When using spread syntax for function calls, be aware of the possibility of exceeding the JavaScript engine's argument length limit." is a thing that could happen.

Rest looks like spread but does the opposite of what spread does. Takes all and makes into one array.
