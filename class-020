SQLBolt was a very nice experience, straight forward and gives directions and documentation above.

W3 is bigger sand box type stuff which information from SQLBolt is very handy for.

Cant believe Primer on SQL is free, lots of content that would possibly be useful if i knew more about it.

Cheat sheet is always a instant bookmark!
