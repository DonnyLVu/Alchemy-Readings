There's so many to choose from. Each one of the genres have something that intrigues me, the ones that do the most are in the genres of food (taco?), Games but only interest but in reality not doing (cheap shark just sounds nice to already have because of personal things). Books as like something from a form of library maybe? Possible space related stuff? Those for now but could change via having more or taking away.
